#Spreadsheet-Api-Android-Example

This is an example Android application that used the accountmanager to access the users private spreadsheet feed and lists the available spreadsheet names. The purpose is to demonstrate how to use the [spreadsheet-api](https://github.com/ralph240574/spreadsheet-api) with the Android Account manager.


## How to get started
This API depends on the core [spreadsheet-api] (https://github.com/ralph240574/spreadsheet-api):

Clone it first:

   git clone git://github.com/ralph240574/spreadsheet-api.git
   

Build with Maven:

   mvn clean install
   

Then clone this API:

   git://github.com/ralph240574/spreadsheet-api-android-example.git

Then import it to eclipse and run it with the emulator or your phone.
